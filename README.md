                                                     Trash_To_Tech_[E_BIN]

 E-Bin is an intelligent waste management solution designed to address the rising challenges of solid waste generation, human health risks, and environmental degradation. By combining AI, IoT, and automation, E-Bin not only simplifies waste segregation but also rewards users and notifies authorities in real-time, fostering a cleaner and smarter environment.
This project uses the Ultralytics YOLOv8 model to perform real-time object detection through your webcam feed. It leverages a trained model (best.pt) to detect and classify objects from live video input with high accuracy.

                                                    Components Used

  1) IR Sensor: Counts waste items.
  2) Ultrasonic Sensor: Monitors bin fill level.
  3) Load Cell: Measures bin weight.
  4) Solar Panel: Renewable energy support.
  5) Cooling Fan: Controls internal heat buildup.
